# The explanation for GPE was correct for Mississippi as it is a city. The term GPE is however a bit convoluted.

# The explanation for PERSON was correct for both the Queen and Mary however Mary, although it is a name, is not a recognisable individual
# unless it is referring to Mary from the bible.
